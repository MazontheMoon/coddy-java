/*
Create a function named modifySpeech that receives words and intensity as its parameters.

The function simulates a revolutionist's speech by manipulating an array of words based on certain conditions. It modifies the speech based on the intensity level, using array slicing and conditional statements.

The function should modify the speech based on the following rules:

If the intensity is 1 or 2, return the first half of the words.
If the intensity is 3, return the original array of words.
If the intensity is 4 or 5, add an exclamation mark to the end of each word and return the entire array.
For any intensity level, if the word "butter" appears in the speech, replace it with "revolution" to emphasize the revolutionist's message.
Parameters:

words (String[]): An array of strings representing the words in the speech.
intensity (int): An integer representing the intensity level of the speech (1 to 5).
The function returns a String array containing the modified speech based on the given rules.
