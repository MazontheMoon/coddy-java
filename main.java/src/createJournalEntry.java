/*Create a function named createJournalEntry that receives int marineSpecies, int birdSpecies, and int currentDay as its parameters.

The function should generate a field journal entry for a naturalist exploring a coastal village. It will format the information into a concise journal entry, using string formatting and basic increment/decrement operators.

The journal entry should include the following information:

The next day of the expedition (current day + 1)
The total number of species observed (sum of marine and bird species)
A breakdown of marine and bird species
A status message based on the total number of species observed:
If total species is less than 5: "Quiet day"
If total species is between 5 and 10: "Productive day"
If total species is more than 10: "Extraordinary day"
Parameters:

marineSpecies (int): The number of marine species observed that day
birdSpecies (int): The number of bird species spotted that day
currentDay (int): The current day of the expedition
The function returns a formatted string representing the journal entry.

Example of the expected format:

Day 4: 
Total species observed: 8
Marine species: 3
Bird species: 5
Status: Productive day
Use string formatting to create the journal entry and increment/decrement operators to adjust the day count and calculate totals. Your solution should be between 10 and 19 lines of code.*/

class CreateJournalEntry {
    public static String createJournalEntry(int marineSpecies, int birdSpecies, int currentDay) {
        int nextDay = ++currentDay;
        int totalSpecies = marineSpecies + birdSpecies;
        String status;
        
        if (totalSpecies < 5) {
            status = "Quiet day";
        } else if (totalSpecies <= 10) {
            status = "Productive day";
        } else {
            status = "Extraordinary day";
        }
        
        return String.format("Day %d: \nTotal species observed: %d\nMarine species: %d\nBird species: %d\nStatus: %s",
                             nextDay, totalSpecies, marineSpecies, birdSpecies, status);
    }
}
