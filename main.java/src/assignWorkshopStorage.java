/*
Write a function assignWorkshopStorage that takes toolNames, shelfCapacity and returns a string array mapping each tool to its storage type.

The function assigns storage locations for workshop tools: - "coated-container" for tools containing "wrench",
- "spherule-box" for tools containing "bolt" or "screw", and "shelf" for all other tools.

Conditions:
- Skip any empty or null tool names using continue
- Stop processing when shelfCapacity tools have been assigned using break
- Return only the assignments for processed tools

Parameters:
- toolNames (String[]): Array of tool names to process
- shelfCapacity (int): Maximum number of tools to assign storage
- Returns: String array of storage assignments for processed tools.
- Format: ["coated-container", "shelf", "spherule-box"]
