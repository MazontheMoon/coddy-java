/*
Create a function named createFieldNotes that receives animals and observations as its parameters.

As a curious naturalist exploring a riverbank, you've been recording observations about the local wildlife. Your task is to create a formatted field note entry from your raw data.

The function should combine the animal names with their corresponding observations, number each entry, and add a simple header and footer to the notes. If no observations were made (i.e., the arrays are empty), the function should return a message indicating this.

Parameters:
- animals (String[]): An array containing names of river animals.
- observations (String[]): An array containing brief observations about each animal.
The function returns a String representing the formatted field notes.

The field notes should be formatted as follows:
- Start with the header: "Riverbank Wildlife Observations:"
- For each animal and observation pair, create a numbered entry: "[number]. [animal]: [observation]"
- End with the footer: "End of observations."
- If the arrays are empty, return "No observations made today."
Note: Ensure proper capitalization and punctuation in your output.
