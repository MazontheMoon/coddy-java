/*
Create a function named geothermalDescent that receives initialElevation, slopeChanges, and geothermalActivity as its parameters.

The function simulates a hiker's journey through a geothermal landscape, calculating the final elevation and the number of significant geothermal features encountered.

During the hiker's descent:

If the geothermal activity level is above 0.75, the hiker takes a detour, skipping the next slope change (use continue).
If the geothermal activity level is above 0.9, it's too dangerous to proceed, and the hiker must end the journey early (use break).
A significant geothermal feature is counted when the activity level is between 0.5 and 0.75 (inclusive).
Use compound assignment operators (+=, -=) and increment/decrement operators (++, --) to update the hiker's elevation. Incorporate Math.sin() to add variability to the slope changes.

Parameters:

initialElevation (int): The starting elevation of the hiker in meters.
slopeChanges (int[]): An array representing the slope changes (positive for uphill, negative for downhill).
geothermalActivity (float[]): An array representing geothermal activity levels at each step.
The function returns an integer array with two elements: the final elevation of the hiker and the count of significant geothermal features encountered.
